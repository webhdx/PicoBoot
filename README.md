This is long awaited IPL replacement modchip for Nintendo GameCube.<br />
It's open source, cheap and easy to install.

## Features
* open source
* uses $4 Raspberry Pi Pico board
* very easy installation, only 5 wires to solder or a flex cable
* upgradable via USB cable, without any drivers and programs
* automatically boots any homebrew app of your choice
* similar experience to ODEs like FlippyDrive or GC Loader

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Prior to PicoBoot v0.4, wiring was slightly different and most videos available online cover the old wiring method. You no longer need to bridge pins GP6 and GP7. If you are making fresh PicoBoot installation please follow new wiring diagram. If you are updating from older firmware, you don't have to change the wiring at all as new firmware is backwards compatible.

> [!TIP]
> Documentation covering [Installation](https://support.webhdx.dev/gc/picoboot/installation-guide) and [Troubleshooting](https://support.webhdx.dev/gc/picoboot/troubleshooting) is hosted at [support.webhdx.dev](https://support.webhdx.dev/gc/picoboot).
