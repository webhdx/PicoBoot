# PicoBoot

This is a long awaited IPL replacement modchip for Nintendo GameCube. It's open source, cheap and easy to install.

## Difference from the original Picoboot
webhdx's PicoBoot: https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot doesn't support boards other than the official Raspberry Pi Pico. This repository enables the led support on RP2040 Zero board.

## Features
* it's open source
* uses Raspberry RP2040 microcontroller powered RP2040 Zero board
* very easy installation, only 5 wires to solder
* programmable via USB cable, without any drivers and programs
* automatically boots any DOL app of your choice
* uses "IPL injection" approach superior to mods like XenoGC
